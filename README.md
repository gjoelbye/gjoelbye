### Hej — I’m Anders 👋🇩🇰

I’m a Dane and a PhD fellow at DTU (DDSA PhD Fellow), currently visiting Stanford’s **STAIR Lab**. I work at the intersection of trustworthy ML, causality, and neuroscience/healthcare—with a slightly more *theory / math* tilt than average, but always grounded in real data. STAIR focuses on developing principles and practices of trustworthy machine learning, including fairness and robustness, with applications to healthcare and neuroimaging [oai_citation:0‡stairlab.stanford.edu](https://stairlab.stanford.edu/#:~:text=The%20Stanford%20Trustworthy%20AI%20Research,applications%20to%20healthcare%20and%20neuroimaging).

#### Currently I’m…
- Interested in **AI alignment** and what’s happening *inside* neural networks—how representations form, align, and sometimes fail in ways that matter for robustness and interpretability. This also motivates my recent work on **spectral PLS** (exploring missing‑data–induced phase transitions) and on **mental rotation** as a controlled probe [oai_citation:1‡arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271#:~:text=,constraints%20in%20embedding%20space%20representations).
- Developing **PatternLocal** from our NeurIPS paper *“Minimizing False‑Positive Attributions in Explanations of Non‑Linear Models”* [oai_citation:2‡arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11210#:~:text=,dataset%2C%20demonstrating%20physiologically%20plausible%20explanations)—aimed at reducing spurious feature attributions while keeping local surrogate explanations faithful.
