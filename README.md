### Hej — I’m Anders 👋🇩🇰

I’m a Dane and a PhD fellow at DTU (DDSA PhD Fellow), currently visiting Stanford’s **STAIR Lab**. I work at the intersection of trustworthy ML, causality, and neuroscience/healthcare—with a slightly more *theory / math* tilt than average, but always grounded in real data.

#### Currently I’m…
- Interested in **AI alignment** and what’s happening *inside* neural networks—how representations form, align, and sometimes fail in ways that matter for robustness and interpretability. This also motivates my recent work on **spectral PLS** (exploring missing-data–induced phase transitions) and on **mental rotation** as a probe.
- Developing **PatternLocal** from our NeurIPS paper *“Minimizing False-Positive Attributions in Explanations of Non-Linear Models”*—aimed at reducing spurious feature attributions while keeping local surrogate explanations faithful.

#### Background & affiliations

- [**Visiting scholar at Stanford’s STAIR Lab**](https://stairlab.stanford.edu/) focusing on trustworthy AI and its applications to neuroimaging.
- [**DDSA fellow and Young Academy Panel member**](https://ddsa.dk/yap/) representing early-career data scientists.
- [**Pioneer Centre for AI**](https://www.aicentre.dk/people/anders-gjolbye-madsen) collaboratories on signals, decoding and causal explainability.
- Previously built **SPEED** with collaborators at ETH Zürich and the University of Zurich ([DTU Orbit publication](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/speed-scalable-preprocessing-of-eeg-data-for-self-supervised-lear/)).
- Worked with **BrainCapture**, a startup bringing accessible EEG solutions worldwide ([overview](https://healthtechhub.org/news/braincapture-receives-ce-mark-expanding-access-to-innovative-eeg-technology/)).
- Co-founded **Copenhagen MedTech** and ran a Google Cloud hackathon project (on my GitHub).

#### Selected publications & projects
- **[Minimizing False-Positive Attributions in Explanations of Non-Linear Models](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Minimizing+False-Positive+Attributions+in+Explanations+of+Non-Linear+Models)** (NeurIPS 2025) — introduces PatternLocal to suppress false-positive feature attributions.  
- **[SPEED: Scalable Preprocessing of EEG Data for Self-Supervised Learning](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Speed%3A+Scalable+Preprocessing+of+EEG+Data+for+Self-Supervised+Learning)** (MLSP 2024) — a pipeline that stabilises self-supervised training on EEG and improves downstream performance.  
- **[Concept-Based Explainability for an EEG Transformer Model](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Concept-Based+Explainability+for+an+EEG+Transformer+Model)** (MLSP 2023) — adapts concept activation vectors to EEG transformers.  
- **[Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Large+Vision+Models+Can+Solve+Mental+Rotation+Problems)** (2025 preprint) — shows self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised models and that intermediate layers outperform final layers.  
- *Missing-Data-Induced Phase Transitions in Spectral PLS for Multimodal Learning* — forthcoming preprint (links coming soon).
