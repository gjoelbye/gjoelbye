### Hej — I’m Anders 👋🇩🇰

I’m a Dane and a PhD fellow at DTU (DDSA PhD Fellow), currently visiting Stanford’s **STAIR Lab**. I work at the intersection of trustworthy ML, causality, and neuroscience/healthcare—with a slightly more *theory / math* tilt than average, but always grounded in real data.

#### Currently I’m…
- [**Visiting researcher at Stanford’s STAIR Lab**](https://stairlab.stanford.edu/) focusing on trustworthy AI.
- Interested in **AI alignment** and what’s happening *inside* neural networks—how representations form, align, and sometimes fail in ways that matter for robustness and interpretability. This also motivates my recent work on **spectral PLS** (including missing-data–induced phase transitions) and on **mental rotation** as a probe.
- Developing **PatternLocal** from our NeurIPS paper *“Minimizing False-Positive Attributions in Explanations of Non-Linear Models”*—aimed at reducing spurious attributions while keeping local explanations faithful.
- Working on the new Danish AI supercomputer [**Gefion**](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/denmark-sovereign-ai-supercomputer/) to use Neural Architecture Search (NAS) to find the optimal EEG foundation model.

#### Background & affiliations
- [**PhD candidate at DTU**](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/persons/anders-gjølbye-madsen/) (Applied Mathematics & Computer Science) working on the *Causal Approach to Trustworthy AI in Healthcare* project ([DDSA page](https://ddsa.dk/member/anders-gjolbye-madsen/)).
- [**Stanford STAIR Lab**](https://stairlab.stanford.edu/) (visiting), with a focus on trustworthy AI and applications to neuroimaging.
- [**DDSA fellow and Young Academy Panel member**](https://ddsa.dk/yap/) representing early-career data scientists.
- [**Pioneer Centre for AI**](https://www.aicentre.dk/people/anders-gjolbye-madsen) collaboratories on signals, decoding, and causal explainability.
- **Exchange at ETH Zürich**, where I studied mathematics and collaborated with the **University of Zurich**—work that led to **SPEED** ([DTU Orbit publication](https://orbit.dtu.dk/en/publications/speed-scalable-preprocessing-of-eeg-data-for-self-supervised-lear/)).
- Worked with [**BrainCapture**](https://healthtechhub.org/news/braincapture-receives-ce-mark-expanding-access-to-innovative-eeg-technology/), a startup bringing accessible EEG solutions worldwide.
- Co-founded [**Copenhagen MedTech**](https://dk.linkedin.com/company/cph-medtech), which (among many events) ran a [**Google Cloud Hackathon**](https://github.com/gjoelbye/GoogleBrainCaptureHackathon).
- **Competitive programming** enthusiast (ICPC style contests).

#### Selected publications & projects
- **[Minimizing False-Positive Attributions in Explanations of Non-Linear Models](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Minimizing+False-Positive+Attributions+in+Explanations+of+Non-Linear+Models)** (NeurIPS 2025) — introduces PatternLocal to suppress false-positive feature attributions.  
- **[SPEED: Scalable Preprocessing of EEG Data for Self-Supervised Learning](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Speed%3A+Scalable+Preprocessing+of+EEG+Data+for+Self-Supervised+Learning)** (MLSP 2024) — a pipeline that stabilizes self-supervised training on EEG and improves downstream performance.  
- **[Concept-Based Explainability for an EEG Transformer Model](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Concept-Based+Explainability+for+an+EEG+Transformer+Model)** (MLSP 2023) — adapts concept activation vectors to EEG transformers.  
- **[Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Large+Vision+Models+Can+Solve+Mental+Rotation+Problems)** (ICASSP 2026) — shows self-supervised ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised models, and that intermediate layers outperform final layers.  
- *Missing-Data-Induced Phase Transitions in Spectral PLS for Multimodal Learning* — forthcoming preprint (links coming soon).
